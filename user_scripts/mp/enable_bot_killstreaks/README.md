Script files to enable multiplayer bots to gain and deploy various killstreaks in-game.

Stable version 1.0 Github Repo: https://github.com/LogicalLeap/enable_bot_killstreaks
Github pre-release for the new experimental version: https://github.com/LogicalLeap/enable_bot_killstreaks/releases/tag/experimental

If anyone has any feedback or requests feel free to let me know. I might add more killstreak loadout possibilities for the bots and even enable them to use nukes if anyone is interested.


*** Bot Killstreaks by Sly Elliot ***


/// HOW TO INSTALL v1.0 /// 

These two files are for server hosts or local private match players to enable bots in multiplayer to use killstreaks.

Drop the enable_bot_killstreaks.gsc file into your user scripts folder located at:
user_scripts\mp

Replace your current _hardpoints.gsc file with the new one from this download. _hardpoints.gsc is located in:
